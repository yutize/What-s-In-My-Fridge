# Icons

These icons were downloaded from https://icons.radix-ui.com/ which is licensed
under MIT: https://github.com/radix-ui/icons/blob/master/LICENSE

It's important that you only add icons to this directory that the application
actually needs as the `vite-plugin-icons-spritesheet` plugin is configured to
generate a spritesheet with icons from this directory. The plugin re-runs on
every edit/delete/add to this directory.
